# Paw Diary Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Consistency
Frontend and backend code interfaces MUST maintain consistent formatting and clear specifications. All API contracts between frontend and backend MUST be well-defined with explicit type definitions, documented schemas, and consistent naming conventions. This ensures maintainability, reduces bugs from interface mismatches, and enables parallel development by different team members.

### II. Layered Architecture
Project structure MUST avoid excessive files in single directories and overly large files. Each directory SHOULD contain no more than 10-15 files, and each source file SHOULD remain under 500 lines. Complex functionality MUST be split into logical modules following proper separation of concerns. This prevents cognitive overload, improves code navigation, and ensures the codebase remains manageable as it scales.

### III. Code Reusability
Common functionality MUST be extracted into shared utilities and components, especially in frontend code. Similar functions MUST NOT be duplicated across the codebase. Features MUST be organized into clear functional areas with appropriate abstraction levels. This reduces maintenance burden, ensures consistency across features, and accelerates development through component reuse.

## Development Standards

### Testing Requirements
- All new features MUST include appropriate test coverage
- Unit tests for business logic components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for UI elements

### Documentation Standards
- All public APIs MUST be documented with clear descriptions
- Complex algorithms MUST include explanatory comments
- Architecture decisions MUST be documented in specs/

### Code Quality Gates
- ESLint and Prettier MUST pass before commits
- TypeScript strict mode MUST be enabled
- Rust clippy warnings MUST be addressed

## Governance

### Amendment Process
1. Proposed changes MUST be documented with clear rationale
2. Changes affecting core principles require team consensus
3. Version MUST follow semantic versioning rules
4. All changes MUST be reflected in dependent templates

### Versioning Policy
- MAJOR: Removal or fundamental change to core principles
- MINOR: Addition of new principles or significant expansions
- PATCH: Clarifications, formatting, and minor updates

### Compliance Review
- All pull requests MUST verify constitution compliance
- Architecture changes MUST align with layered architecture principle
- New components MUST follow reusability patterns
- API changes MUST maintain interface consistency
