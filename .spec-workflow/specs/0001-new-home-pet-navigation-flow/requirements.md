# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature refines the Pawdiary UI/UX to provide a more modern, unified, and streamlined navigation experience centered around pet profiles. The feature transforms the current pet list view into an iPhone-like horizontal swipeable interface where each pet has their own dedicated profile page with prominent photo display and integrated activity management. This creates a more intimate, pet-centric experience that aligns with the app's diary-like aesthetic and emotional design principles.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the core product goals outlined in product.md:

**Multi-Pet Management**: Enhances the seamless switching between pet profiles with a modern, touch-friendly interface that works consistently across desktop and mobile platforms.

**Warm Experience**: Creates a more intimate diary-like interface with large pet photos and dedicated profile pages, moving away from traditional list-based interfaces toward a more personal, emotionally engaging experience.

**Structured Recording**: Integrates the "Add Activity" functionality directly into each pet's profile page, reducing friction in the core user workflow and making activity logging more intuitive.

**Key Features Alignment (M1 Foundation Framework)**:
- **Pet Management**: Complete pet profiles with enhanced photo display and seamless multi-pet switching
- **Activity Recording**: Direct integration of activity recording from pet profile pages
- **Basic UI**: Warm, card-based interface with paw print branding elements and smooth transitions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Homepage Navigation Logic

**User Story:** As a first-time pet owner or returning user, I want the app to intelligently determine my homepage view based on whether I have pets, so that I can quickly access the most relevant functionality without confusion or extra navigation steps.

### Requirement 2: Horizontal Pet Profile Navigation

**User Story:** As a multi-pet owner, I want to swipe horizontally between my pets' individual profile pages, so that I can quickly switch focus between different pets with a natural, mobile-friendly gesture that feels familiar from other apps.

6. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL update the active pet state to reflect the currently visible pet
7. IF the interface is on desktop THEN the system SHALL provide clickable navigation arrows for horizontal movement

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Pet Profile Display

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want each of my pets to have their own dedicated profile page with a prominent photo display and essential information, so that I feel more emotionally connected to my pet's digital presence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN no photo is available THEN the system SHALL display a warm, branded placeholder that maintains the intimate aesthetic
3. WHEN viewing a pet profile THEN the system SHALL show key details including name, age, species, gender, and breed in a clean, card-based format
4. WHEN viewing a pet profile THEN the system SHALL display recent activity overview/summary
5. WHEN the pet photo is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply a slightly blurred background effect to create visual depth and focus
6. WHEN viewing a pet profile THEN the interface SHALL maintain the warm color scheme (cream, light yellow, light blue) and paw-themed branding

### Requirement 4: Integrated Activity Management

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to quickly add new activities directly from my pet's profile page, so that I can efficiently log important events and observations without navigating away from the pet's context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a pet profile THEN the system SHALL display a prominent "Add Activity" button integrated into the page layout
2. WHEN the "Add Activity" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL open the activity creation interface with the current pet pre-selected
3. WHEN an activity is successfully added THEN the system SHALL refresh the pet profile to show the updated activity overview
4. WHEN viewing the activity overview THEN the system SHALL display the most recent activities with timestamps and brief descriptions
5. WHEN clicking on an activity in the overview THEN the system SHALL provide quick access to view or edit that activity

### Requirement 5: Seamless Add Pet Integration

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want the Add Pet functionality to be seamlessly integrated into the horizontal navigation flow, so that expanding my pet family feels natural and consistent with the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN pets exist THEN the Add Pet interface SHALL appear as the rightmost page in the horizontal navigation
3. WHEN the Add Pet page is accessed THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly form with large photo upload area and simple form fields
4. WHEN a pet is successfully added THEN the system SHALL automatically navigate to the new pet's profile page and set them as active
5. WHEN creating a new pet THEN the system SHALL position them as the rightmost pet profile (before Add Pet page)

### Requirement 6: Responsive Behavior Consistency

**User Story:** As a pet owner using different devices, I want the navigation experience to work consistently across desktop and mobile platforms, so that I can use the app effectively regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a touch device THEN the system SHALL support native touch gestures for horizontal swiping
2. WHEN using a desktop device THEN the system SHALL provide clickable navigation arrows and/or mouse wheel scrolling for horizontal movement
3. WHEN the viewport changes size THEN the system SHALL maintain the active pet focus and navigation state
4. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL remember the last active pet and resume from their profile
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL optimize touch targets and spacing for finger-friendly interaction

### Requirement 7: Visual Transition and Performance

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want smooth, responsive transitions between pet profiles, so that the interface feels polished and enjoyable to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pet profiles THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations with transitions completing in under 300ms
2. WHEN loading pet photos THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states to maintain perceived performance
3. WHEN swiping/navigating THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback to confirm user interactions
