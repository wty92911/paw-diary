# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Activity Pages feature transforms the current embedded activity system into independent, dedicated pages that provide better context, improved editing experiences, and clearer user mental models. This feature addresses the current limitations where activities are mixed within pet profiles, causing confusion about pet-activity relationships and providing limited editing space for complex activity records.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the core Product Vision goals:

- **Structured Recording**: Transforms daily observations into categorized, searchable records through dedicated activity pages
- **Visual Timeline**: Provides complete chronological view of pet's life with enhanced filtering and management
- **Multi-Pet Management**: Strengthens pet-activity binding by requiring explicit pet context for all activity operations
- **Warm Experience**: Maintains diary-like interface while providing full-screen editing capabilities
- **Local Privacy**: All activity data remains locally managed with enhanced organization

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pet-Bound Activity Context

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want all activities to be clearly associated with a specific pet, so that I never confuse which pet an activity belongs to and understand that activities cannot exist without a pet context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access any activity functionality THEN the system SHALL require an active pet context (pet ID in URL path)
2. IF no pet is selected THEN the system SHALL prevent activity creation/editing and redirect to pet selection
3. WHEN I view an activity page THEN the system SHALL display the associated pet's name and photo prominently in the header
4. WHEN I create a new activity THEN the system SHALL automatically bind it to the current pet context
5. WHEN I switch between pets THEN the system SHALL show only activities belonging to the selected pet

### Requirement 2: Independent Activities List Page

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want a dedicated page showing all activities for a specific pet, so that I can browse, filter, and manage the complete activity timeline without the distractions of pet profile information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/pets/:petId/activities` THEN the system SHALL display a dedicated activities list page
2. WHEN I view the activities page THEN the system SHALL show activities in reverse chronological order (newest first)
3. WHEN I view the activities page THEN the system SHALL provide category filtering options (health, growth, diet, lifestyle, expenses)
4. WHEN I click on an activity card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the activity editing page
5. WHEN I long-press an activity card THEN the system SHALL show quick action menu (edit, delete, copy)
6. WHEN I use the floating action button THEN the system SHALL navigate to new activity creation page

### Requirement 3: Full-Screen Activity Editor

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want a dedicated full-screen editing experience for activities, so that I can comfortably input complex information including multiple photos, detailed descriptions, and structured data without space constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/pets/:petId/activities/new` THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen activity creation form
2. WHEN I navigate to `/pets/:petId/activities/:activityId/edit` THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen activity editing form
3. WHEN I view the activity editor THEN the system SHALL show the pet's name and photo in the header to maintain context
4. WHEN I use the activity editor THEN the system SHALL support all three editing modes (Quick, Guided, Advanced)
5. WHEN I save an activity THEN the system SHALL return to the activities list and highlight the created/updated activity
6. WHEN I cancel editing THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation if changes exist and return to the activities list

### Requirement 4: Simplified Pet Profile

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want the pet profile to focus on basic pet information, so that I can quickly view pet details without being overwhelmed by activity data, while still having easy access to recent activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a pet profile THEN the system SHALL display only basic pet information (name, photo, birth date, breed, etc.)
2. WHEN I view a pet profile THEN the system SHALL show only the most recent 1-3 activities as a preview
3. WHEN I view a pet profile THEN the system SHALL provide a prominent "View All Activities" button
4. WHEN I click "View All Activities" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the dedicated activities page for that pet
5. WHEN I view a pet profile THEN the system SHALL NOT display the full activity timeline or complex activity management controls

### Requirement 5: Navigation Flow and Breadcrumbs

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want clear navigation between pet profiles, activity lists, and activity editors, so that I always know where I am and can easily return to previous contexts without losing my place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the activities page THEN the system SHALL provide a clear back button to return to the pet profile
2. WHEN I view the activity editor THEN the system SHALL provide a clear back button to return to the activities list
3. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected pet context
4. WHEN I use browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL handle navigation correctly
5. WHEN I view any activity-related page THEN the system SHALL display breadcrumb-style navigation showing the current location

### Requirement 6: Activity Management Operations

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want comprehensive activity management capabilities including creation, editing, deletion, and duplication, so that I can efficiently maintain accurate pet records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new activity THEN the system SHALL support template selection and mode selection via URL parameters
2. WHEN I edit an activity THEN the system SHALL preserve the original creation timestamp while updating the modification timestamp
3. WHEN I delete an activity THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation and provide undo capability
4. WHEN I duplicate an activity THEN the system SHALL create a new activity with copied data but current timestamp
5. WHEN I perform bulk operations THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and error handling

### Requirement 7: Draft and Auto-Save Support

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want my activity editing progress to be automatically saved as drafts, so that I don't lose work if I accidentally navigate away or the application closes unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start creating/editing an activity THEN the system SHALL auto-save draft progress every 30 seconds
2. WHEN I return to an incomplete activity THEN the system SHALL restore draft content and prompt whether to continue
3. WHEN I complete and save an activity THEN the system SHALL clear the associated draft
4. WHEN I have multiple drafts THEN the system SHALL manage them per pet context to prevent confusion
5. WHEN drafts are older than 7 days THEN the system SHALL automatically clean them up

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
