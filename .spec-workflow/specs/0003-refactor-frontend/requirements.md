# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current `App.tsx` file has grown to over 500 lines and contains mixed responsibilities including navigation, pet management, activity management, and UI rendering. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the codebase difficult to maintain and extend. This specification outlines the requirements to refactor the frontend architecture into a clean, modular structure with proper page-level routing and component separation.

The refactor will transform the monolithic `App.tsx` into a clean router-based architecture where pets are the core entity, each pet has its own activity timeline, and activities are strictly bound to specific pets rather than being global.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This refactor directly supports several key goals from the product vision:

- **Multi-Pet Management**: Clean separation of pet profiles with structured data organization supports seamless pet switching
- **Structured Recording**: Activities properly bound to pets enables better data organization and insights
- **Warm Experience**: Improved component structure allows for better implementation of the diary-like interface
- **Local Privacy**: Proper architecture facilitates secure local data management
- **Performance Standards**: Modular components support the <1 second display requirement

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: App Router Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want App.tsx to serve only as a routing entry point, so that the application has clear navigation structure and each page has a single responsibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN App.tsx SHALL contain only React Router configuration and route definitions
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the router SHALL handle all navigation logic without manual state switching
3. WHEN App.tsx is loaded THEN it SHALL be less than 50 lines of code containing only routing setup
4. WHEN examining App.tsx THEN it SHALL not contain any UI components beyond the Router setup

### Requirement 2: Homepage with Pet Overview

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to see all my pets in a thumbnail view on the homepage, so that I can quickly navigate to any pet's profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the root path ("/") THEN the system SHALL display the HomePage component
2. WHEN no pets exist THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to "/pets/new"
3. WHEN pets exist THEN the HomePage SHALL display pet thumbnails in a horizontal scrollable layout
4. WHEN clicking a pet thumbnail THEN the system SHALL navigate to "/pets/:petId"
5. WHEN viewing pet thumbnails THEN each SHALL display pet photo, name, and basic info

### Requirement 3: Pet Profile Page with Activity Timeline

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to view a specific pet's profile and activity history in one place, so that I can track that pet's complete journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing "/pets/:petId" THEN the system SHALL display the PetProfilePage component
2. WHEN the PetProfilePage loads THEN it SHALL show the pet's profile header with photo and basic information
3. WHEN the PetProfilePage loads THEN it SHALL display the pet's activity timeline in chronological order
4. WHEN viewing activities THEN all activities SHALL belong only to the current pet (no global activities)
5. WHEN clicking "Add Activity" THEN the system SHALL open a form that automatically associates the activity with the current pet

### Requirement 4: Dedicated Pet Creation Page

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want a dedicated form for adding new pets, so that I can input pet information without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing "/pets/new" THEN the system SHALL display the AddPetPage component
2. WHEN submitting the pet creation form THEN the system SHALL create a new pet and navigate to "/pets/:newPetId"
3. WHEN the AddPetPage loads THEN it SHALL display a clean form without other UI elements
4. WHEN pet creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to the new pet's profile page

### Requirement 5: Component Modularization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components organized by feature and responsibility, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows single responsibility principle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the components directory THEN pet-related components SHALL be in `components/pets/`
2. WHEN examining the components directory THEN activity-related components SHALL be in `components/activities/`
3. WHEN examining individual components THEN each SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
4. WHEN examining PetActivityTimeline THEN it SHALL only display activities for a specific petId parameter
5. WHEN examining ActivityForm THEN it SHALL automatically bind activities to the current pet context

### Requirement 6: Pet-Bound Activity Management

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want activities to be clearly associated with specific pets, so that each pet's history is separate and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new activity THEN it SHALL be automatically associated with the current pet's ID
2. WHEN viewing a pet's timeline THEN it SHALL show only activities belonging to that pet
3. WHEN switching between pets THEN each pet's activity timeline SHALL be completely separate
4. WHEN examining activity data THEN every activity SHALL have a required petId field
5. WHEN deleting a pet THEN all associated activities SHALL be handled appropriately (cascade or archive)

### Requirement 7: Navigation State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth navigation between pets and pages, so that the app feels responsive and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages THEN React Router SHALL handle all navigation state
2. WHEN using browser back/forward buttons THEN the application SHALL respond correctly
3. WHEN bookmarking a pet's profile page THEN the direct URL SHALL work properly
4. WHEN the page refreshes THEN the current pet context SHALL be preserved through the URL
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN page transitions SHALL complete within 500ms

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: App.tsx serves only as router, each page component handles one specific view, each hook manages one data domain
- **Modular Design**: Components organized by feature (`pets/`, `activities/`), pages separated from components, hooks isolated by data type
- **Dependency Management**: Pages depend on components, components depend on hooks, hooks depend on utilities - no circular dependencies
- **Clear Interfaces**: TypeScript interfaces for all props, clear API contracts for all hooks, consistent naming conventions

### Performance

- **Navigation Speed**: Page transitions complete within 500ms
- **Component Loading**: Individual components load within 200ms
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory footprint through proper component cleanup and React Router optimization
- **Bundle Size**: Modular architecture enables code splitting and tree shaking

### Security

- **Data Binding**: Activities strictly bound to pets prevents data leakage between pet profiles
- **Navigation Security**: React Router provides secure client-side navigation without exposing sensitive data in URLs
- **Component Isolation**: Pet data isolated within appropriate component boundaries

### Reliability

- **Error Boundaries**: Each major page wrapped in error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- **Data Consistency**: Pet-activity relationships maintained at all times through proper data binding
- **Navigation Fallbacks**: Proper 404 handling and redirect logic for invalid routes

### Usability

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear URL structure (`/pets/123`) that users can understand and bookmark
- **Responsive Design**: All refactored components maintain responsive behavior across screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during navigation and data fetching
- **Back Navigation**: Browser back button works as expected in all contexts
