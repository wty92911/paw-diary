# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Activity Recording System enables pet owners to capture and organize their pets' daily activities across five core categories: Health, Growth, Diet, Lifestyle, and Expenses. This system transforms scattered observations into structured, searchable records that form the foundation of comprehensive pet care tracking. The system provides an intuitive interface that allows users to record activities in under 3 steps while maintaining rich data capture capabilities.

The Activity Recording System serves as the cornerstone of the Paw Diary application, enabling pet owners to move beyond simple photo collections to meaningful, organized pet care documentation.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the core product vision of "transforming scattered photos and notes into meaningful visual data and insights." Specifically:

- **Structured Recording**: Converts daily observations into categorized, searchable records that replace scattered notes and chat logs
- **Multi-Pet Management**: Supports seamless activity recording across multiple pet profiles with organized switching
- **Visual Timeline**: Creates chronological activity displays that preserve memory while providing data insights
- **Local Privacy**: All activity data stored locally with complete user control and optional cloud sync
- **Warm Experience**: Maintains diary-like interface with pet-themed design that feels caring rather than clinical

The system establishes the foundation for M2 data visualization features by ensuring high-quality, consistent activity data capture during M1.
