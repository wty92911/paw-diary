# Research: Universal Header Component

**Feature**: Universal Header Component for iOS App  
**Date**: 2025-09-20  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Analysis  

## Research Questions Addressed

### 1. React Component Architecture for Header Variants

**Decision**: Compound Component Pattern with Context API  
**Rationale**: 
- Provides flexible composition while maintaining consistent API
- Enables easy variant creation (AppHeader, PetHeader, FormHeader) without prop drilling
- Supports nested components (HeaderBrand, HeaderNavigation, HeaderActions)
- Aligns with Shadcn UI patterns already used in project

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single component with variant props: Too rigid for complex layouts
- Higher-order component pattern: Less TypeScript-friendly and composable
- Render props pattern: Overly complex for this use case

### 2. TailwindCSS Design System Integration

**Decision**: Utility-first with CSS-in-JS fallback for dynamic styles  
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing TailwindCSS setup in project
- Maintains design consistency with current orange/yellow theme
- Enables responsive design with built-in breakpoint system
- CSS variables for theme colors ensure consistency

**Alternatives Considered**:
- CSS modules: Additional build complexity for minimal benefit
- Styled-components: Not used elsewhere in project
- Pure CSS: Less maintainable and harder to make responsive

### 3. Shadcn UI Component Integration

**Decision**: Extend existing Shadcn components (Button, Badge, etc.)  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains visual consistency with current UI components
- Provides accessible defaults and focus management
- Built-in TypeScript support and variant system
- Reduces bundle size by reusing existing components

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom UI components: Reinventing existing accessible patterns
- Different UI library: Breaking consistency with current design system
- Headless UI only: More implementation work for styling

### 4. iOS Human Interface Guidelines Compliance

**Decision**: Implement iOS navigation patterns in web context  
**Rationale**:
- Large touch targets (44pt minimum) for mobile-like experience
- System-style back button with chevron-left icon
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper contrast ratios
- Support for iOS accessibility features (VoiceOver-compatible)

**Key Patterns**:
- Navigation bar height: 44px (iOS standard)
- Back button placement: Leading edge with proper spacing
- Title positioning: Center or leading based on context
- Action placement: Trailing edge for primary actions

### 5. State Management for Header Context

**Decision**: React Context API with reducer pattern  
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight solution for header-specific state
- No external state management library required
- Easy testing and debugging
- Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux/Zustand: Overkill for header state only
- Prop drilling: Becomes unwieldy with deep component trees
- Local state only: Cannot share context across route changes

### 6. Performance Optimization Strategies

**Decision**: Memoization with React.memo and useMemo  
**Rationale**:
- Header renders on every navigation change
- Pet context data unlikely to change frequently
- Icon and image assets can be preloaded
- Component-level memoization prevents unnecessary re-renders

**Key Optimizations**:
- Lazy load pet photos with placeholder fallbacks
- Memoize navigation handlers and context calculations
- Use React.memo for sub-components (HeaderButton, HeaderBrand)
- Optimize icon bundle size with tree-shaking

### 7. Accessibility Implementation

**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with React accessibility libraries  
**Rationale**:
- Built-in support for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Focus management for programmatic navigation
- Semantic HTML structure with proper landmark roles
- High contrast color schemes for visual accessibility

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, button)
- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Test with VoiceOver/NVDA screen readers

### 8. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Component testing with React Testing Library + Jest  
**Rationale**:
- Tests user interactions rather than implementation details
- Integrates well with existing project test setup
- Supports accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Enables snapshot testing for visual regression detection

**Test Coverage Areas**:
- Variant rendering (app vs pet vs form headers)
- Navigation behavior and routing integration
- Accessibility compliance and keyboard navigation
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Loading and error states

## Dependencies Analysis

### Required Dependencies
- `@radix-ui/react-*`: Already in project for Shadcn components
- `lucide-react`: Already in project for icons
- `react-router-dom`: Already in project for navigation
- `class-variance-authority`: Already in project for variant styling

### No Additional Dependencies Required
All necessary libraries are already available in the project, ensuring no bundle size increase or dependency management complexity.

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Aspect | Decision | Impact |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Architecture | Compound Component + Context | High flexibility, type safety |
| Styling | TailwindCSS utilities | Consistent with project |
| Components | Shadcn UI extensions | No new dependencies |
| State | React Context + Reducer | Lightweight, testable |
| Performance | React.memo + useMemo | Optimized re-renders |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | Inclusive design |
| Testing | React Testing Library | User-focused tests |

## Implementation Readiness

All research questions have been resolved with clear technical decisions. No external dependencies or major architectural changes required. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design and contracts.
