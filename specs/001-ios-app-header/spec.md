# Feature Specification: Universal Header Component for iOS App

**Feature Branch**: `001-ios-app-header`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Our iOS experience needs a single reusable header component that keeps navigation, branding, and contextual information consistent across every screen."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   - Identify the need for a unified header component to align navigation and branding
2. Extract key concepts from description
   - Actors: iOS app users, developers; Actions: navigate, display context; Data: app branding, navigation state; Constraints: cross-screen consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   - Clarify navigation behavior through review of current implementations
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   - Capture user flows that stress home, profile, activity, and form screens
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   - Ensure each requirement is testable and implementation agnostic
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   - Document header, navigation, context, and accessibility entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   - Confirm requirements and scenarios cover success, error, and accessibility needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid implementation details (no tech stack, APIs, or code structure)
- Write for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a pet owner using the Paw Diary iOS app, I want consistent navigation and visual identity across all screens so that I can efficiently navigate between different sections without confusion and maintain a cohesive user experience that feels like a unified application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the home page, **When** I navigate to any other screen (add pet, pet profile, activities), **Then** the header should maintain consistent visual styling and behavior patterns
2. **Given** I am viewing my pet's profile, **When** I navigate to activities or edit screens, **Then** the header should display relevant pet context while maintaining navigational consistency
3. **Given** I am on any deep screen (activity editor, pet editor), **When** I want to navigate back, **Then** the header should provide clear and consistent back navigation that follows iOS HIG patterns
4. **Given** I am using the app across different screen sizes, **When** viewing any page header, **Then** the header should adapt responsively while maintaining its core identity and functionality
5. **Given** I am performing any primary action (adding pet, creating activity), **When** I look at the header, **Then** I should see clear visual hierarchy that indicates my current location in the app

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the app branding needs to accommodate extremely long pet names in pet context headers?
- How does the header handle network connectivity issues when pet context is required but data is unavailable?
- What happens when users have accessibility features enabled (larger text, reduced motion)?
- How does the header behave during app state transitions (loading, error states)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a unified header component that maintains consistent visual identity across all application screens
- **FR-002**: System MUST display contextual information in headers based on the current screen (pet context for pet-related screens, app branding for general screens)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide consistent back navigation behavior that follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- **FR-004**: System MUST support responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining usability
- **FR-005**: System MUST display clear visual hierarchy indicating user's current location within the application
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle loading and error states gracefully within the header component
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide accessible navigation controls that work with iOS accessibility features
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme aligned with the app's design system
- **FR-009**: System MUST support both sticky and non-sticky positioning based on page requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide configuration options for different header variants (app-level, pet-context, form-based) without code duplication

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Header Component**: Reusable UI component that provides consistent navigation and branding, with configurable content based on context
- **Navigation Context**: Information about current screen location, back navigation target, and breadcrumb hierarchy
- **Pet Context**: Pet-specific information (name, photo, species) displayed when user is viewing pet-related screens
- **Brand Identity**: Consistent visual elements (logo, colors, typography) that maintain app identity across all screens
- **Accessibility Configuration**: Settings that ensure the header works with iOS accessibility features such as VoiceOver and Dynamic Type
