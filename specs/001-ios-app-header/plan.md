# Implementation Plan: Universal Header Component for iOS App

**Branch**: `001-ios-app-header` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-ios-app-header/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a unified header component for the Paw Diary iOS app using React, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI to ensure consistent navigation and visual identity across all screens. The component will support configurable variants (app branding, pet context, form-based) while maintaining iOS Human Interface Guidelines compliance and responsive design principles.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with React 18+ on Tauri 2.x desktop app  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, Lucide React (icons), React Router  
**Storage**: Local state management for header configuration, no persistent storage required  
**Testing**: React Testing Library, Jest, Vitest for component testing  
**Target Platform**: Desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux) via Tauri, optimized for mobile-like UI patterns
**Project Type**: web (frontend component within Tauri app)  
**Performance Goals**: <16ms render time for smooth 60fps interactions, <50KB bundle size impact  
**Constraints**: iOS HIG compliance, accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA), responsive 320px-1920px  
**Scale/Scope**: 6-8 main app screens, 3 header variants, 4-5 reusable sub-components

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Code Consistency ✅
- Header component interfaces will maintain consistent formatting with TypeScript definitions
- Props and configuration APIs will follow existing React component patterns in the codebase
- Naming conventions will align with existing component structure (PetContextHeader, PetProfileHeader)

### Layered Architecture ✅
- Single component directory will contain ~5-8 files (Header, variants, types, styles)
- Each component file will remain under 300 lines following separation of concerns
- Clear module boundaries: HeaderProvider (context), HeaderVariants (components), HeaderTypes (interfaces)

### Code Reusability ✅  
- Shared header component will eliminate current duplication across 6+ pages
- Common navigation patterns extracted into reusable HeaderButton, HeaderBreadcrumb sub-components
- Configuration system will enable variant reuse without code duplication

**Initial Assessment**: PASS - No constitutional violations detected

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Frontend component within existing Tauri React app structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
