# Bug Report

## Bug Summary

Multiple critical issues affecting the "Add New Pet" functionality including app crashes during photo capture, suboptimal mobile UX with dialog-based flow, and input zoom behavior that degrades user experience on mobile devices.

## Bug Details

### Expected Behavior

1. **Photo Capture**: When selecting "Take Photo" from upload options, the device camera should open, allow photo capture, and return the image to the pet creation form without crashing
2. **Mobile Navigation**: On mobile devices, tapping "Add New Pet" should navigate to a dedicated full-screen page with proper navigation controls (back button in top-left corner)
3. **Input Experience**: Mobile text inputs should not trigger automatic zoom when focused, allowing smooth typing without viewport changes

### Actual Behavior

1. **Photo Capture Crash**: When selecting "Take Photo" from the upload options (Photo Library / Take Photo / Choose File), the application crashes and exits unexpectedly
2. **Dialog-Based Mobile Flow**: Currently, "Add New Pet" opens a dialog/modal on mobile devices, which provides poor UX on smaller screens and doesn't follow mobile design patterns
3. **Input Zoom Issue**: On mobile devices, focusing on input fields causes unwanted pinch/focus zoom, disrupting the user experience and making typing difficult

### Steps to Reproduce

#### Issue 1: Photo Capture Crash
1. Open Paw Diary application on mobile device
2. Tap "Add New Pet" button
3. Navigate to photo upload section in the form
4. Select "Take Photo" option from the upload choices
5. Observe that the app crashes and exits immediately

#### Issue 2: Mobile Dialog UX
1. Open Paw Diary application on mobile device
2. Tap "Add New Pet" button on the main page
3. Observe that a dialog/modal opens instead of navigating to a dedicated page
4. Note the lack of proper mobile navigation patterns (back button, full-screen layout)

#### Issue 3: Input Zoom Behavior
1. Open Paw Diary application on mobile device
2. Tap "Add New Pet" button
3. Focus on any text input field (name, breed, etc.)
4. Observe that the screen zooms in automatically
5. Note difficulty typing and navigating with the zoomed viewport

### Environment

- **Version**: Latest development version (Tauri 2.x)
- **Platform**: Mobile devices (iOS/Android - depending on Tauri mobile support)
- **Configuration**: Tauri desktop application with mobile-responsive UI

## Impact Assessment

### Severity

- [x] High - Major functionality broken
- [ ] Critical - System unusable
- [ ] Medium - Feature impaired but workaround exists
- [ ] Low - Minor issue or cosmetic

### Affected Users

- **Primary Impact**: All mobile users attempting to add new pets
- **Secondary Impact**: Desktop users with touch devices or small screens
- **Photo Capture**: Users specifically trying to take new photos (vs. uploading existing ones)

### Affected Features

- **Pet Creation Workflow**: Core functionality for adding new pets is impaired
- **Photo Integration**: Camera functionality completely broken on mobile
- **Mobile User Experience**: Overall mobile usability significantly degraded
- **Input Handling**: Text input experience poor on mobile devices

## Additional Context

### Error Messages

```
[No specific error messages captured - app crashes immediately on photo capture]
[Need to check console logs and crash reports for detailed error information]
```

### Screenshots/Media

- Photo capture crash occurs immediately upon selecting "Take Photo" option
- Mobile dialog appears cramped and doesn't utilize full screen real estate effectively
- Input zoom behavior is visually jarring and disrupts workflow

### Related Issues

- This may be related to Tauri mobile capabilities and camera permissions
- Mobile responsiveness and touch interface optimization needed
- CSS viewport and input handling configuration required

## Initial Analysis

### Suspected Root Cause

#### Issue 1: Photo Capture Crash
- **Tauri Mobile Permissions**: Camera permissions may not be properly configured
- **Plugin Missing**: Required Tauri camera/media plugin may not be installed or configured
- **Platform Incompatibility**: Photo capture functionality may not be implemented for mobile platforms

#### Issue 2: Mobile Dialog UX
- **Responsive Design**: Current implementation uses desktop-oriented dialog component
- **Navigation Pattern**: Missing mobile-specific navigation implementation
- **Route Handling**: No dedicated route/page for mobile pet creation flow

#### Issue 3: Input Zoom Behavior
- **Viewport Meta Tag**: Missing or incorrect viewport configuration preventing zoom control
- **CSS Properties**: Need user-scalable=no or font-size adjustments to prevent auto-zoom
- **Input Styling**: Touch-target sizing may trigger browser zoom behavior

### Affected Components

**Frontend Components:**
- **File**: `src/components/pets/PetForm.tsx`
  - **Issue**: Dialog-based implementation not mobile-optimized
  - **Issue**: Photo upload handling may lack mobile camera integration

**Mobile Optimization:**
- **File**: `public/index.html` or equivalent
  - **Issue**: Viewport meta tag configuration for zoom control

**Photo Handling:**
- **File**: `src/hooks/usePhotos.ts` (if exists)
  - **Issue**: Camera capture functionality implementation

**Tauri Configuration:**
- **File**: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
  - **Issue**: Camera permissions and mobile capabilities

**Styling:**
- **File**: `src/styles/globals.css`
  - **Issue**: Mobile input styling and touch-target optimization

### Dependencies

- Tauri mobile plugin ecosystem (camera, file system permissions)
- Browser camera API and permissions handling
- CSS viewport and touch interaction handling
- React Router (if implementing page-based navigation)
- Mobile-specific UI components and patterns
